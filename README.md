Replication code for "American Nationalism and the 'Curse of Rurality': Urban-Rural Differences and the Notion of National Belonging"

**Abstract**
Relationship between nationalism and urban or rural environment is not one that is often studied, apart from traditional historical interpretation of it being a modern, urban phenomenon, characterized by imagery and discourse of rurality. Yet it seems that, in the last several decades, not only have nationalist conflicts mostly been rooted within the countryside and nationalist agendas won on elections in them, but that there is a more fundamental connection between nationalism and rurality. While briefly addressing this issue, this paper focuses on the analysis of 2014 GSS data, exploring the relationship between the place of living and the notion of national belonging. What is presented is a clear, but not conclusive, evidence on the presence of more nationalistic attitudes among persons living in rural areas, especially among those who spent most of their childhood in them.
